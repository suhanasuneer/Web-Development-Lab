<h1>Department Of Computer Application</h1>
<p>The Department of Computer Applications was established in 2008 with an intake of 60 Students. MCA Department, right from its inception, has been maintaining a good track record in all areas of academics and non-academics. It serves with the prime objectives of educating and preparing learners as dynamic professionals so that they can compete in the present global situation.
